    <h2>FAQ</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>Q: Am I allowed use library X (where X is the name of any Arduino library)?</p>
	<p>A: The standard C libraries (<a href="http://cplusplus.com/reference/">http://cplusplus.com/reference/</a>, under the heading "C Library") are permitted. In addition, headers of the form <code>&lt;avr/xxx.h&gt;</code>, plus <code>&lt;util/delay.h&gt;</code>, are permitted. If X is not covered by these descriptions, X cannot be used. And certain libraries, such as <code>time.h</code>, are not available in a microcontroller, so they cannot be used either.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				Q: How original does my application have to be?</p>
				<p>A: Your idea doesn't have to be very original; for example, porting a real-life game (such as Mah Jong, Old Maid, Snap, Piggy In The Middle) or homage to existing video game genres is reasonable. But your implementation must be completely original.</p>
			<p>Practical applications such as home automation devices are fine in principle, but may have difficulty incorporating multiple learning outcomes in a coherent and cohesive manner. Certain applications may require substitution of other similar devices in the TinkerCad implementation. If that is the case, the substitution must be an incontestably direct replacement for the substituted object, such that the analogy between real device and substituted TinkerCad component is clear and not contrived.&nbsp; </p>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Specification</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>You are required to invent, design, implement, document, and demonstrate the prototype of a microcontroller-based product – hereafter referred to as the application – which showcases your mastery of learning outcomes in CAB202. </li>
        <li>The application must perform some meaningful service, carry out a specific useful function, or in general be a cohesive and sensible construct which will deliver valuable functionality.
 
 

 











            <ol>
                <li>The application is NOT a compendium of unrelated software and hardware snippets aggregated into a single package in a coincidental manner.</li>
                <li>The specific task, purpose, or valuable functionality inherent in your application is left to you to choose. Thus, this task is an opportunity for you to indulge your interests and ideally create a prototype product which will have enduring value for you, either in the course of your professional development, or as a chance to implement something of practical utility for yourself or others.</li>
                <li>A very broad range of application areas will be accepted, including but not limited to such things as prototype hand-held games, home automation helpers, assistive technologies for people with disabilities, musical instruments, or scientific instruments.

 





                    <ul>
                        <li>Note well: if you decide to implement a hand-held game, you must implement a playable and original game which exercises every element of claimed functionality.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Constraints</h2>
    <p>
        Your application prototype must conform to the following constraints:
 
 
 

    </p>
    <ol start="3">
        <li>The application must demonstrate proficiency with up to 8 distinct instances of the following specific functional capabilities, each of which is directly related to CAB202 learning outcomes.
 
 

 



 























            <ol type="a">
                <li>Digital I/O – switch</li>
                <li>Digital I/O – interrupt-based debouncing</li>
                <li>Digital I/O – LED</li>
                <li>Analog Input</li>
                <li>Analog Output (PWM) – hardware-based; OR software-based “bit-banging”</li>
                <li>Serial I/O – hardware based; polling OR interrupt mediated</li>
                <li>LCD – simple text display; OR: bit-mapped graphics, including sprites, line or pixel art</li>
                <li>Timers – other than debouncing or PWM</li>
                <li>Other advanced hardware interaction. Options include:
 
 

 



 























                    <ul>
                        <li>LED matrix display built from first principles; 
 </li>
                        <li>music synthesis tool; 
 </li>
                        <li>signal processing tool; 
 </li>
                        <li>distributed computing application
 </li>
                        <li>Serial I/O – SPI or I2C, hardware-based; OR via bespoke code –“bit banging”</li>
                        <li>Subject to prior approval in writing from Unit Coordinator or delegate </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Subject to prior approval in writing from Unit Coordinator or delegate </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>In this context, “distinct instance” mean that each category will be scored once. Thus, using 8 buttons counts as a single instance of learning outcome (a) in the list above. Debouncing 4 switches counts as a single instance of learning outcome (b). No learning outcome will be allocated credit more than once during marking.</p>

        </li>
        <li>The application must be implemented via a private TinkerCad Circuit emulation. Include a shared link to this as part of your submission.
</li>
        <li>The application must be runnable – that is, all functionality claimed for the application must be able to be exercised via software included in the TinkerCad Circuit, and which executes correctly when the “Start Simulation” action is invoked.
</li>
        <li>The software required to run your application must be fully self-contained, and consist entirely of original software crafted by you.
 
 

 



 























            <ol type="a">
                <li>Third party libraries or source code obtained from any source other than the CAB202 teaching materials are strictly prohibited.
 </li>
                <li>You may use all functions in the standard C library, including any file which may be included via a C pre-processor directive<br>
                    <code>#include &lt;somefile.h&gt;</code><br>
                    and which compiles correctly on AMS.
 </li>
                <li>Generic techniques or algorithms sourced from external sites and adapted to your setting is permitted, however the implementation of such algorithms must be demonstrably your own work. Due citation is required for any such algorithms. </li>
            </ol>

        </li>
        <li>All software must be written using the C programming language.
 
 

 











            <ul>
                <li>Attach all source files below and use the Submit button to verify that your software conforms to this requirement.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Submission Requirements</h2>
    <p>You must submit the following items:</p>
    <ol start="8">
        <li>Complete source code for the software required to run your application must be submitted using the form below.
 
 





            <ul>
                <li>The program MUST compile successfully in AMS, or a score of 0 will be recorded for this assessment item.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>A shared link to your private TinkerCad Circuit where the prototype application is implemented.
 
 





            <ul start="8">
                <li>This should be included in your report. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>A recorded audio-visual screen-cast (maximum of 5 minutes duration) which demonstrates all functionality for which you are claiming credit.
 
 





            <ol type="a">
                <li>The submitted video must be viewable, audible, and submitted according to the prescribed submission mechanism, or a score of 0 will be recorded for this assessment item.</li>
                <li>The video must be well-scripted and presented in a professional manner using audio as well as visual channels to convey information. Some examples of acceptable and unacceptable scripting follow:
 
 





                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Good</strong>: “Now as I turn Player 1 Potentiometer clockwise, observe as the paddle icon moves upward on the LCD.” – synchronised properly with corresponding visual cues and clearly visible results.</li>
                        <li><strong>Good</strong>: “Watch the status LEDs on the breadboard as I click the Increment button four times. You expect to see the LEDs light up in order from left to right with each button release. One, two, three, four. See, the fourth LED is no lit up.” – with appropriate pauses and if necessary with careful mouse gestures to direct the viewer’s gaze.
</li>
                        <li><strong>Not good</strong>: “OK, let’s move the paddles. Yup that works.”
</li>
                        <li><strong>Not good</strong>: Led Zeppelin’s “Immigrant Song” played at volume 11 over the top of the voice-over. Or any other musical backing, unless your application is a synthesizer of some kind.
</li>
                        <li><strong>Not good</strong>: Any distractions, either visual or auditory. This includes the neighbour’s lawn mower.
</li>
                        <li><strong>Not good</strong>: “Here we go…”. – followed by a lengthy period of silence punctuated by strained grunts and exhalations –” see, that works perfectly!”
</li>
                        <li><strong>Not good</strong>: Dialog of high quality, but accompanied by flailing mouse movements or other visual effects which hurt the marker’s eyes. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>A written report containing the following sections:
 


            <ol type="a">
                <li>A succinct but comprehensive introduction which fully describes the use case targeted by your application, justifying the value of the application, and setting out clearly how each claimed learning outcome is showcased by your application, and describes how each component contributes to the overall functionality of the application.
 </li>
                <li>A detailed set of wiring instructions which clearly and without ambiguity defines every component and hardware connection in your application. Some examples of acceptable and unacceptable wiring instructions follow:
 


                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Good</strong>: ”Connect LED 2: place LED 2 on the breadboard to the right of LED 1; connect pin 13 to the cathode of LED 2; connect the anode of LED 2 to one end of a distinct 220 Ohm resistor; connect the other end of the resistor to ground”.</li>
                        <li><strong>Not good</strong>: ”Plug a LED into pin 13”.</li>
                        <li><strong>Not good</strong>: ”Connect Door Open Switch: see attached diagram”. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>A fully labelled schematic diagram which shows the named components and their connections. All components are thoughtfully laid out and the overall presentation of the diagram ensures that it will be easy for users to create the application. 
 


                    <ul>
                        <li>A link to the TinkerCad Circuit by itself does not meet this requirement</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

    <h2>Academic conduct</h2>
    <p>This is not a group assignment. While we encourage you to discuss the assignment and brain-storm with your associates, you must ensure that your submission is your own individual work.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Share ideas, not code!</li>
        <li>An impeccable standard of academic integrity is required. Breaches of academic integrity, including plagiarism or any other action taken to subvert, circumvent, or distort the assessment process, will not be tolerated. QUT policy regarding academic conduct is available in the QUT MOPP Section C/5.3 Academic Integrity. In particular, under the provisions of MOPP statement C/5.3.7, Part (e), we reserve the right to require you to authenticate your learning. You may be required to show evidence of materials used in the production of the assignment such as notes, drafts, sketches or historical backups. You may also be required to undertake a viva or complete a supervised practical exercise.</li>
        <li>Do not post your solution in any form of publicly accessible online repository or file sharing service, or allow anybody else to obtain access to your solution in any way. Doing so will be classified as academic misconduct under the clauses pertaining to collusion, especially in the event that a copy of your source code obtained from such a service is submitted by another student, regardless of whether this has occurred without your knowledge and permission.</li>
        <li>Abundant code samples, demonstrations, and exercises have been made available to support your effort toward this programming task. Written permission must be obtained from the Unit Coordinator if you want to use technology other than the libraries supplied this semester to implement your application. Permission will only be granted if there are compelling special circumstances that make it impossible for you to use the libraries supplied this semester. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Breaching any of the foregoing conditions will result in an immediate and final score of 0 for the Assignment.</p>
    <h2><strong>Notes:</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>For purposes of AMS assessment, this activity has been classified as non-assessed. This does not mean the assignment is non-assessable – it means that the system is not able to assess the assignment automatically. AMS will not enforce a hard close-down for submissions, however in line with QUT policy, late submissions without an approved extension will not be marked. If special circumstances prevent you from meeting the assessment due date, you can <a href="https://www.student.qut.edu.au/studying/assessment/late-assignments-and-extensions">apply for an extension</a> <em>before the due date</em>. If you don’t have an approved extension you should submit the work you have completed by the due date and it will be marked against the assessment criteria.</p>
